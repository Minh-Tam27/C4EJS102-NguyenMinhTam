    <h1> Session 3 - Homework 8</h1>
    <p>
        You are a shepherd who owns a flock of sheep
    </p>
    <p>
        Each of your sheep of your flock has varied sizes:
    </p>
    <p>
        8.1.	Create an array to represent the sizes of your flock, and log all of your flock size, expected screen output
    </p>
    <p>
        8.2.	At the end of each month, you have to choose one and only one sheep to shear and thus you want to choose the biggest one to maximize your profit. Add scripts to search for the biggest sheep in your list
    </p>
    <p> Hint: Google ‘JS Array find max’</p>
    <p>
        8.3.	When your biggest sheer, its size will return to the default size, which is 8.
    </p>
    <p>
        Hint: Google 'JS Array indexOf'
    </p>
    <p>
        8.4.	In the following month, EVERY sheep in your flock grow, they have their size increased by 50. Log them out
    </p>
    <p>
        8.5.	Let’s do this for 4 months (or as long as you want)
    </p>
    <p>
        8.6.	After day by day shearing sheep, you became bored. You want to sell your flock to travel the world. In order to have fair trade, you must now calculate the total size of your sheep and then the expected money you can get from selling your flock, before going to the market. Write a program to calculate the total size of your sheep as well as the money you would have. Expected console output
